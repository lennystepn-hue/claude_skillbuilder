First, analyze the staged changes by examining:\n   - Modified files and their paths\n   - Added/deleted lines of code\n   - New files created or files deleted\n   - Changes to configuration files, documentation, tests, etc.\n\n2. Determine the appropriate conventional commit type:\n   - `feat`: new features\n   - `fix`: bug fixes\n   - `docs`: documentation changes\n   - `style`: formatting, missing semicolons, etc.\n   - `refactor`: code changes that neither fix bugs nor add features\n   - `test`: adding or updating tests\n   - `chore`: maintenance tasks, dependency updates\n   - `perf`: performance improvements\n   - `ci`: CI/CD related changes\n   - `build`: build system or external dependency changes\n\n3. Identify the scope (optional but recommended):\n   - Component, module, or area of the codebase affected\n   - Use lowercase and keep it concise\n\n4. Write a clear, concise description:\n   - Use imperative mood (\"add\" not \"added\")\n   - Start with lowercase letter\n   - No period at the end\n   - Maximum 50 characters for the subject line\n\n5. Add body (if needed) explaining the \"what\" and \"why\"\n6. Add footer for breaking changes or issue references\n\n## Examples\n\n**Input**: User has staged changes that add a new login function to the auth module\n**Output**: `feat(auth): add user login functionality`\n\n**Input**: User has staged changes fixing a null pointer exception in the payment service\n**Output**: `fix(payment): handle null pointer in transaction processing`\n\n**Input**: User has staged changes updating README.md with new installation instructions\n**Output**: `docs: update installation instructions in README`\n\n**Input**: User has staged changes that rename variables and format code in multiple files\n**Output**: `style: improve code formatting and variable naming`\n\n**Input**: User has staged breaking changes to the API authentication\n**Output**: \n```\nfeat(auth)!: implement OAuth2 authentication\n\nBREAKING CHANGE: removed basic auth support, all clients must use OAuth2\n```",
