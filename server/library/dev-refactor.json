Analyze the code:\n   - Identify code smells (long methods, duplicate code, etc.)\n   - Check for violations of SOLID principles\n   - Look for performance issues\n   - Assess readability and naming\n\n2. Plan refactoring:\n   - Prioritize changes by impact\n   - Ensure behavior is preserved\n   - Consider test coverage\n\n3. Apply refactoring patterns:\n   - **Extract Method**: Break up long functions\n   - **Rename**: Use descriptive names\n   - **Remove Duplication**: DRY principle\n   - **Simplify Conditionals**: Guard clauses, early returns\n   - **Decompose**: Single responsibility\n\n4. Explain changes:\n   - What was changed and why\n   - Benefits of the refactoring\n   - Any trade-offs made\n\n## Examples\n\n**Input:** \"refactor this\"\n```javascript\nfunction process(d) {\n  if (d) {\n    if (d.items) {\n      let t = 0;\n      for (let i = 0; i < d.items.length; i++) {\n        t = t + d.items[i].price * d.items[i].qty;\n      }\n      return t;\n    }\n  }\n  return 0;\n}\n```\n\n**Output:**\n```javascript\nfunction calculateOrderTotal(order) {\n  if (!order?.items?.length) {\n    return 0;\n  }\n  \n  return order.items.reduce(\n    (total, item) => total + item.price * item.qty,\n    0\n  );\n}\n```\n\n**Changes:**\n- ✅ Descriptive function name\n- ✅ Guard clause instead of nested ifs\n- ✅ Optional chaining for safety\n- ✅ Reduce instead of manual loop\n- ✅ Clear variable names",
