It covers stakeholder analysis, communication planning, executive reporting, change management communication, and conflict resolution. Perfect for project managers, product managers, and team leads managing complex stakeholder landscapes.\n\n## Activation\n\nThis skill activates when users request:\n- Stakeholder management or analysis\n- Status updates or progress reports\n- Executive summaries or dashboards\n- Communication plans or strategies\n- Stakeholder mapping or power-interest grids\n- Change management communication\n- Escalation or conflict resolution\n- Project announcements or launches\n\n## Instructions\n\n### Stakeholder Analysis\n\n1. **Identify Stakeholders**\n   - Direct: Project team, sponsors, customers\n   - Indirect: Adjacent teams, executives, partners\n   - External: Vendors, regulators, end users\n\n2. **Analyze Stakeholder Attributes**\n   - **Power**: Can they influence the project?\n   - **Interest**: How much do they care?\n   - **Impact**: How does the project affect them?\n   - **Attitude**: Supporter, neutral, or blocker?\n\n3. **Create Power-Interest Grid**\n   ```\n   High Power │ Manage Closely │ Keep Satisfied │\n             │  (Key Players)  │  (Influential)  │\n             ├────────────────┼─────────────────┤\n   Low Power │ Keep Informed  │    Monitor      │\n             │   (Engaged)    │   (Minimal)     │\n             └────────────────┴─────────────────┘\n               High Interest    Low Interest\n   ```\n\n4. **Develop Engagement Strategy**\n   - Key Players: Active collaboration, frequent updates\n   - Influential: Regular briefings, seek input on big decisions\n   - Engaged: Periodic updates, keep in the loop\n   - Minimal: Broadcast updates only\n\n### Creating Status Updates\n\n1. **Know Your Audience**\n   - Executives: High-level, business impact, decisions needed\n   - Team: Tactical, blockers, next actions\n   - Customers: Value delivered, timelines, changes\n\n2. **Structure for Clarity**\n   - TL;DR / Executive Summary (2-3 sentences)\n   - Progress (what shipped, metrics)\n   - Blockers (what's at risk, help needed)\n   - Next Steps (what's coming, timeline)\n\n3. **Use Visual Elements**\n   - Status indicators (🟢 On Track, 🟡 At Risk, 🔴 Blocked)\n   - Progress bars or percentages\n   - Charts for trends\n   - Screenshots or demos when possible\n\n4. **Be Transparent**\n   - Share bad news early\n   - Explain \"why\" not just \"what\"\n   - Propose solutions, not just problems\n   - Give credit where due\n\n### Communication Planning\n\n1. **Define Communication Goals**\n   - Inform (awareness)\n   - Consult (gather input)\n   - Collaborate (joint decisions)\n   - Empower (delegate authority)\n\n2. **Choose Communication Channels**\n   - Synchronous: Meetings, video calls, Slack huddles\n   - Asynchronous: Email, docs, recorded videos\n   - Formal: Executive presentations, all-hands\n   - Informal: Coffee chats, hallway conversations\n\n3. **Set Communication Cadence**\n   - Daily: Team standups, critical updates\n   - Weekly: Progress reports, team meetings\n   - Bi-weekly: Stakeholder check-ins\n   - Monthly: Executive reviews, all-hands\n   - Ad-hoc: Escalations, urgent changes\n\n4. **Create Communication Matrix**\n   | Stakeholder | What | How | When | Owner |\n   |-------------|------|-----|------|-------|\n   | CEO | Strategic updates | Email summary | Monthly | PM |\n   | Team | Daily progress | Slack + standup | Daily | TL |\n\n## Examples\n\n### Example 1: Weekly Executive Status Update\n\n**User Request**: \"Write a weekly status update for our CEO on the platform migration project.\"\n\n**Assistant Response**:\n\n```markdown\n# Platform Migration - Weekly Status Update\n**Week of January 15, 2024** | **Project Week 12 of 20**\n\n---\n\n## TL;DR\n\n🟡 **At Risk** - Migration is 60% complete, but we discovered database performance issues that may delay launch by 2 weeks. Need executive decision on timeline vs. scope trade-off by Friday.\n\n**Key Numbers**:\n- **Progress**: 60% complete (target: 65% by EOW)\n- **Budget**: $680K spent of $1M (68%, on track)\n- **Timeline**: 8 weeks remaining → potentially 10 weeks\n- **Risk Level**: Medium → High (escalated this week)\n\n---\n\n## This Week's Achievements\n\n### ✅ Major Milestones\n\n1. **Completed Wave 2 Migration (25% of Data)**\n   - Migrated 500K user records to AWS\n   - Zero data loss, all validation checks passed\n   - Performance metrics meet SLAs (p95 latency <200ms)\n   - Impact: 25% of customers now on new platform\n\n2. **Launched New Admin Dashboard**\n   - Internal tool for monitoring migration status\n   - Real-time metrics on data sync progress\n   - Impact: Reduced manual status checks by 80%\n\n3. **Secured AWS Enterprise Support**\n   - Upgraded to Business support tier\n   - Dedicated Technical Account Manager assigned\n   - Impact: Faster resolution for critical issues\n\n### 📊 Key Metrics\n\n| Metric | This Week | Last Week | Trend |\n|--------|-----------|-----------|-------|\n| Data Migrated | 60% | 50% | 🟢 +10% |\n| Services Moved | 18/30 | 15/30 | 🟢 +3 |\n| Incidents | 2 | 1 | 🟡 +1 |\n| Team Velocity | 85% | 90% | 🟡 -5% |\n| Customer Complaints | 0 | 0 | 🟢 Stable |\n\n---\n\n## Critical Issues & Decisions Needed\n\n### 🔴 Issue #1: Database Performance Below SLA (NEW)\n\n**Problem**: \nWave 2 analytics queries are 3x slower on AWS than on-premise (p95: 600ms vs. 200ms target). Root cause identified as database instance size and indexing strategy.\n\n**Business Impact**:\n- Customer-facing analytics dashboards load slowly\n- Risk: Customer complaints, churn if not resolved\n- Affects: 500K users (25% of base), growing to 2M at launch\n\n**Options**:\n\n| Option | Cost | Timeline | Pros | Cons |\n|--------|------|----------|------|------|\n| A: Upgrade DB instance (RDS) | +$15K/mo | 1 week | Quick fix, proven solution | Ongoing cost increase |\n| B: Optimize queries & indexes | $0 | 3 weeks | No cost increase, better long-term | Delays launch |\n| C: Hybrid (upgrade + optimize) | +$10K/mo | 2 weeks | Balanced approach | Moderate cost + delay |\n\n**Recommendation**: Option C (Hybrid)\n- Rationale: Immediate relief + long-term optimization\n- Trade-off: 2-week delay vs. 25% cost increase (Option A)\n- Impact: Launch moves from March 15 → March 29\n\n**❓ DECISION NEEDED BY**: Friday, Jan 19\n- **Who**: CEO + CFO (budget impact)\n- **Question**: Accept 2-week delay for cost-optimized solution OR pay 25% more for faster launch?\n\n---\n\n### 🟡 Issue #2: Team Capacity Stretched\n\n**Problem**: \n2 engineers out sick this week, reducing velocity by 20%. If trend continues, may need contractor support.\n\n**Impact**: \n- Non-critical features may slip\n- Increased stress on remaining team\n\n**Action Taken**:\n- De-prioritized 3 \"nice to have\" features\n- Paused non-essential work (internal tools)\n- Monitoring team health closely\n\n**Watch Item**: If velocity doesn't recover next week, will recommend hiring 2 contractors ($30K).\n\n---\n\n## What's Next (Week 13)\n\n### Priorities\n\n1. **Resolve Database Performance** (Critical)\n   - Implement Option A, B, or C per your decision\n   - Target: p95 latency <250ms by EOW\n   - Owner: Database team\n\n2. **Begin Wave 3 Migration (30% of Data)**\n   - Migrate 600K additional user records\n   - Includes highest-value enterprise customers\n   - Owner: Migration team\n\n3. **Security Audit Prep**\n   - External audit scheduled Week 14\n   - Preparing documentation and access\n   - Owner: Security team\n\n### Timeline Updates\n\n```\nOriginal Plan:\n├─ Wave 2 (25%) ✅ Complete (Week 12)\n├─ Wave 3 (30%) 🔄 In Progress (Weeks 13-14)\n├─ Wave 4 (45%) ⏳ Upcoming (Weeks 15-17)\n└─ Final Cutover ⏳ March 15 → March 29 (PENDING DECISION)\n```\n\n---\n\n## Risks & Mitigation\n\n### Top 3 Risks (This Week)\n\n1. **Database Performance** (NEW - Critical)\n   - Status: 🔴 Active issue\n   - Mitigation: Decision needed on resolution approach\n\n2. **Team Burnout** (Escalated from Medium)\n   - Status: 🟡 Monitoring\n   - Mitigation: Reduced scope, considering contractors\n\n3. **Data Migration Errors** (Stable - Medium)\n   - Status: 🟢 Controlled\n   - Mitigation: Validation scripts catching issues early\n\n*Full risk register: [Link to detailed RAID log]*\n\n---\n\n## Budget & Resources\n\n### Spend Summary\n\n| Category | Budget | Spent | Remaining | % Used |\n|----------|--------|-------|-----------|--------|\n| AWS Infrastructure | $400K | $280K | $120K | 70% |\n| External Consultants | $200K | $150K | $50K | 75% |\n| Team Costs | $300K | $200K | $100K | 67% |\n| Contingency | $100K | $50K | $50K | 50% |\n| **Total** | **$1M** | **$680K** | **$320K** | **68%** |\n\n**Budget Health**: 🟢 On Track (68% spent at 60% completion)\n\n**Notes**:\n- Database upgrade (if Option A/C chosen) will add $10-15K/month\n- May need contractors ($30K) if velocity doesn't recover\n- Contingency buffer healthy at 50% remaining\n\n---\n\n## Team Morale & Health\n\n- **Sentiment**: 7.2/10 (down from 7.8 last week)\n- **Concern**: Team tired from 2 straight weeks of long hours\n- **Action**: Encouraging time off post-Wave 3, considering team dinner\n\n---\n\n## Customer Impact\n\n- **Migrated Customers**: 500K (25%)\n- **Customer Satisfaction**: 4.6/5 (stable)\n- **Support Tickets**: 12 (down from 18 last week)\n- **Sentiment**: Positive - customers praising new dashboard performance\n\n**Quote from Customer**:\n> \"The new analytics dashboard is noticeably faster.

As we've grown from 50 to 150 people this year, it's time to evolve our structure to match our scale and ambition.\"\n\n**The Change**:\n\"Effective February 1, we're merging our Platform and Infrastructure teams into a unified Engineering organization. This affects 18 people who will have new reporting structures.\"\n\n**The Why**:\n\"This change addresses three things:\n1. Silos: Teams duplicating work, slow decisions\n2. Speed: Faster execution with unified priorities\n3. Scale: Structure that supports 300-person company\n\nThis is about positioning for success, not fixing problems.\"\n\n**What's Not Changing**:\n\"To be clear:\n- No layoffs, everyone has a role\n- No compensation changes\n- No change to our product roadmap or goals\n- Day-to-day work continues\"\n\n**Next Steps**:\n\"Affected individuals have been notified. New org chart is available [link]. Questions? Come to office hours Friday or ask your manager.\"\n\n**Closing**:\n\"Change is uncomfortable but necessary for growth. I'm confident this sets us up for an incredible 2024. Thank you for your adaptability and commitment.\"\n```\n\n### 2. FAQ Document\n\n**Q: Why are we doing this now?**\nA: Our structure was designed for a 50-person company. We're now 150 and growing. This change aligns our structure with our current scale and future plans.\n\n**Q: Is this a layoff?**\nA: No. This is a restructuring. Every person has a role. If there were workforce reductions, we would communicate that clearly and separately.\n\n**Q: How were decisions made about who reports to whom?**\nA: Based on functional alignment, workload distribution, and manager capacity. We aimed for logical team groupings and balanced team sizes.\n\n**Q: What if I'm unhappy with my new manager?**\nA: Give it a few weeks. If concerns persist, talk to your skip-level manager or HR. We're committed to making this work.\n\n**Q: Will there be more changes?**\nA: This is the planned restructuring for now. As we continue to grow, we'll evolve, but no additional changes are planned in the near term.\n\n**Q: How can I provide feedback?**\nA: Talk to your manager, attend office hours Friday, or email people-team@company.com. We want to hear from you.\n\n**Q: What about our current projects?**\nA: Continue as planned. Reporting changes, work doesn't. Managers will coordinate any handoffs.\n\n### 3.
