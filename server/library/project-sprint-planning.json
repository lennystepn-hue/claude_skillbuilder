It combines agile best practices with practical templates to ensure productive sprints.\n\n## Activation\n\nThis skill activates when you need to:\n- Plan an upcoming sprint\n- Refine the product backlog\n- Create or improve user stories\n- Define sprint goals and success criteria\n- Estimate team capacity and velocity\n- Prioritize work items\n- Run sprint planning ceremonies\n\n## Instructions\n\nWhen activated, this skill will:\n\n1. **Backlog Refinement**\n   - Review and prioritize backlog items\n   - Identify dependencies and blockers\n   - Ensure stories are ready for sprint planning\n   - Split large stories into manageable chunks\n\n2. **User Story Creation**\n   - Guide proper user story format\n   - Define acceptance criteria\n   - Add technical notes and constraints\n   - Ensure stories follow INVEST principles\n\n3. **Sprint Goal Definition**\n   - Craft clear, measurable sprint goals\n   - Align goals with product roadmap\n   - Ensure team understanding and buy-in\n\n4. **Capacity Planning**\n   - Calculate available team capacity\n   - Account for PTO, holidays, meetings\n   - Consider team velocity trends\n   - Plan sustainable workload\n\n5. **Estimation & Commitment**\n   - Facilitate estimation sessions\n   - Use planning poker or other techniques\n   - Determine sprint commitment\n   - Identify risks and mitigation strategies\n\n## Templates\n\n### User Story Template\n\n```markdown\n# [Story ID] - [Title]\n\n## User Story\nAs a [type of user]\nI want to [action/goal]\nSo that [benefit/value]\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Given [context], when [action], then [outcome]\n- [ ] Given [context], when [action], then [outcome]\n- [ ] Given [context], when [action], then [outcome]\n\n## Technical Notes\n- APIs/Services affected: [list]\n- Database changes: [list]\n- Third-party integrations: [list]\n- Security considerations: [list]\n\n## Dependencies\n- Blocked by: [story IDs]\n- Blocks: [story IDs]\n- Related to: [story IDs]\n\n## Definition of Done\n- [ ] Code written and peer reviewed\n- [ ] Unit tests written (>80% coverage)\n- [ ] Integration tests passing\n- [ ] Documentation updated\n- [ ] Deployed to staging\n- [ ] Product owner approved\n\n## Estimation\nStory Points: [1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21]\nEstimated Hours: [range]\n\n## Priority\n[Critical | High | Medium | Low]\n```\n\n### Sprint Planning Agenda\n\n```markdown\n# Sprint [Number] Planning\nDate: [Date]\nDuration: 2-4 hours\nAttendees: Dev Team, Product Owner, Scrum Master\n\n## Part 1: Sprint Goal & Backlog Review (60 min)\n\n### Sprint Goal\n[Clear, concise goal that describes what we aim to achieve]\n\n### Key Objectives\n1.
