It generates comprehensive risk registers, mitigation plans, and contingency strategies to increase project success rates and reduce unexpected failures.\n\n## Activation\n\nThis skill activates when users request:\n- Risk assessment or risk analysis\n- Risk registers or RAID logs\n- Mitigation strategies or contingency plans\n- Pre-mortem or failure analysis\n- Project risk management\n- Dependency mapping\n- Assumption validation\n- Issue tracking and escalation\n\n## Instructions\n\n### Conducting Risk Assessment\n\n1. **Identify Risks**\n   - Brainstorm with team (what could go wrong?)\n   - Review similar past projects\n   - Analyze dependencies and assumptions\n   - Consider technical, organizational, and external risks\n\n2. **Analyze and Prioritize**\n   - **Probability**: How likely is this to happen? (Low/Medium/High or 1-5)\n   - **Impact**: If it happens, how bad is it? (Low/Medium/High or 1-5)\n   - **Risk Score**: Probability × Impact\n   - **Priority**: Focus on high-probability, high-impact risks first\n\n3. **Develop Mitigation Strategies**\n   - **Avoid**: Change plans to eliminate the risk\n   - **Mitigate**: Reduce probability or impact\n   - **Transfer**: Shift responsibility (insurance, outsourcing)\n   - **Accept**: Acknowledge and monitor (for low-priority risks)\n\n4. **Create Contingency Plans**\n   - \"If X happens, we will do Y\"\n   - Identify triggers and early warning signs\n   - Assign owners and response procedures\n   - Set aside contingency budget and time\n\n5. **Monitor and Update**\n   - Review risk register weekly\n   - Track risk trends (increasing/decreasing)\n   - Add new risks as they emerge\n   - Archive resolved risks\n\n### Risk Assessment Frameworks\n\n#### RAID Log\n- **R**isks: Future events that might happen\n- **A**ssumptions: Things we believe to be true\n- **I**ssues: Current problems affecting the project\n- **D**ependencies: External factors we rely on\n\n#### Risk Matrix (Probability × Impact)\n\n```\nImpact →     Low(1)  Medium(2)  High(3)  Critical(4)\nProbability ↓\nHigh (4)      4        8         12        16\nMedium (3)    3        6          9        12\nLow (2)       2        4          6         8\nRare (1)      1        2          3         4\n\nPriority:\n12-16: Critical (immediate action)\n6-11: High (active mitigation)\n3-5: Medium (monitor closely)\n1-2: Low (accept and document)\n```\n\n#### Pre-Mortem Technique\n\n\"Imagine it's 6 months from now and the project has failed spectacularly. What went wrong?\"\n\nThis technique reveals risks that traditional brainstorming misses.\n\n## Examples\n\n### Example 1: Software Product Launch Risk Assessment\n\n**User Request**: \"We're launching our new SaaS platform in 3 months. Help me identify and plan for potential risks.\"\n\n**Assistant Response**:\n\n```markdown\n# Risk Assessment: SaaS Platform Launch\n## Project: Customer Analytics Platform v2.0\n**Launch Date**: April 1, 2024 (12 weeks from now)\n**Last Updated**: January 15, 2024\n\n---\n\n## Executive Summary\n\n### Risk Overview\n- **Total Risks Identified**: 18\n- **Critical Priority**: 3 risks (requires immediate action)\n- **High Priority**: 5 risks (active mitigation needed)\n- **Medium Priority**: 7 risks (monitoring required)\n- **Low Priority**: 3 risks (accepted)\n\n### Top 3 Risks\n1. **Data migration failure** (Risk Score: 16) - Could delay launch by 4-6 weeks\n2. **Third-party API dependency** (Risk Score: 12) - Could break core features\n3. **Performance under load** (Risk Score: 12) - Could cause launch-day outage\n\n### Overall Risk Health\n🔴 **HIGH RISK** - Multiple critical risks require immediate mitigation before launch\n\n**Recommendation**: Consider pushing launch by 2-4 weeks to properly mitigate critical risks.\n\n---\n\n## RAID Log\n\n### Risks (Future Events)\n\n#### CRITICAL PRIORITY (Score: 12-16)\n\n##### R-001: Data Migration from v1 to v2 Fails\n- **Category**: Technical\n- **Probability**: Medium (3/4) - Complex migration, limited testing\n- **Impact**: Critical (4/4) - 50K customers unable to access data\n- **Risk Score**: 12\n- **Owner**: Sarah Chen (Data Engineering Lead)\n- **Status**: 🔴 Open\n\n**Description**: \nMigrating 500GB of customer data from legacy MongoDB to new PostgreSQL schema.
