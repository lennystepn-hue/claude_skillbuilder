Determine requirements:\n   - What platform? (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, CircleCI)\n   - What language/framework?\n   - What stages needed? (build, test, deploy)\n   - What environments? (staging, production)\n\n2. Generate pipeline with:\n   - Trigger conditions (push, PR, schedule)\n   - Build stage (install dependencies, compile)\n   - Test stage (unit tests, integration tests, linting)\n   - Security stage (dependency scanning, SAST)\n   - Deploy stage (staging, production)\n   - Notifications (Slack, email)\n\n3. Best practices:\n   - Cache dependencies for speed\n   - Use matrix builds for multiple versions\n   - Separate secrets from code\n   - Add manual approval for production\n\n## Examples\n\n**Input:** \"create github actions for my node app\"\n\n**Output:**\n```yaml\nname: CI/CD Pipeline\n\non:\n  push:\n    branches: [main]\n  pull_request:\n    branches: [main]\n\njobs:\n  test:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v4\n      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4\n        with:\n          node-version: '20'\n          cache: 'npm'\n      - run: npm ci\n      - run: npm test\n      - run: npm run lint\n\n  deploy:\n    needs: test\n    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v4\n      - name: Deploy to production\n        run: echo \"Deploy here\"\n        env:\n          DEPLOY_KEY: ${{ secrets.DEPLOY_KEY }}\n```",
