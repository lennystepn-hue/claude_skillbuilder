It generates roadmaps in multiple formats including timeline views, quarterly plans, and now-next-later frameworks.\n\n## Activation\n\nThis skill activates when users request:\n- Product roadmaps or strategic planning documents\n- Feature prioritization or backlog organization\n- Milestone definitions or release planning\n- Quarterly or annual planning documents\n- Stakeholder roadmap presentations\n- Technology or engineering roadmaps\n\n## Instructions\n\n### Creating a Product Roadmap\n\n1. **Gather Context**\n   - Understand the product vision and business objectives\n   - Identify target audience and key stakeholders\n   - Determine the roadmap timeframe (quarterly, annual, multi-year)\n   - Collect existing feature requests and priorities\n\n2. **Choose the Right Framework**\n   - **Now-Next-Later**: For flexible, outcome-focused roadmaps\n   - **Timeline-based**: For date-driven commitments\n   - **Theme-based**: For organizing by strategic initiatives\n   - **Quarterly**: For aligning with business planning cycles\n\n3. **Prioritize Features**\n   - Apply RICE scoring (Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort)\n   - Use MoSCoW method (Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have)\n   - Create Value vs Effort matrix for visual prioritization\n   - Consider dependencies and technical constraints\n\n4. **Define Milestones**\n   - Set clear, measurable objectives\n   - Include success criteria and KPIs\n   - Establish target dates or timeframes\n   - Identify key deliverables and dependencies\n\n5. **Create Visualizations**\n   - Generate timeline charts\n   - Build prioritization matrices\n   - Create stakeholder-friendly presentations\n   - Produce detailed implementation plans\n\n### Feature Prioritization Process\n\n1. **RICE Scoring**\n   ```\n   RICE Score = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort\n   \n   Reach: Number of users affected per time period\n   Impact: 3 (massive), 2 (high), 1 (medium), 0.5 (low), 0.25 (minimal)\n   Confidence: 100% (high), 80% (medium), 50% (low)\n   Effort: Person-months required\n   ```\n\n2. **Value vs Effort Matrix**\n   - Quick Wins: High value, low effort\n   - Strategic: High value, high effort\n   - Fill-ins: Low value, low effort\n   - Time sinks: Low value, high effort\n\n3. **MoSCoW Analysis**\n   - Must have: Non-negotiable, critical for launch\n   - Should have: Important but not critical\n   - Could have: Nice to have if time permits\n   - Won't have: Out of scope for this release\n\n## Examples\n\n### Example 1: SaaS Product Quarterly Roadmap\n\n**User Request**: \"Create a Q1-Q2 2024 roadmap for our B2B SaaS analytics platform. We need to improve onboarding, add enterprise features, and enhance data visualization.\"\n\n**Assistant Response**:\n\n```markdown\n# Analytics Platform Roadmap - Q1-Q2 2024\n\n## Strategic Themes\n1.

Risk: Distributed transactions, eventual consistency\n   - Mitigation: Saga pattern, event sourcing, compensating transactions\n   - Contingency: Maintain data sync tools, rollback procedures\n\n2. **Performance Degradation**\n   - Risk: Network latency, service chattiness\n   - Mitigation: Caching strategies, GraphQL federation, circuit breakers\n   - Contingency: Keep monolith option for critical paths\n\n3. **Team Knowledge Gap**\n   - Risk: Microservices expertise shortage\n   - Mitigation: Training programs, hire experts, documentation\n   - Contingency: External consultants, extended timelines\n\n### Medium Risks\n4. **Operational Complexity**\n   - Risk: Managing 12+ services vs 1 monolith\n   - Mitigation: Automation, observability tools, SRE practices\n\n5. **Budget Overruns**\n   - Risk: Cloud costs, tooling, extended timelines\n   - Mitigation: FinOps practices, cost monitoring, monthly reviews\n\n## Success Metrics (KPIs)\n\n### Technical Metrics\n- **Deployment Frequency**: 1/week → 10/day\n- **Lead Time for Changes**: 2 weeks → 1 day\n- **MTTR**: 4 hours → 30 minutes\n- **Change Failure Rate**: 15% → 5%\n- **API Response Time**: p95 <200ms\n- **System Uptime**: 99.9% → 99.99%\n\n### Business Metrics\n- **Developer Productivity**: 30% increase in feature velocity\n- **Infrastructure Costs**: Optimize to <20% increase despite 10x scale\n- **Time to Market**: 50% reduction for new features\n- **Customer Satisfaction**: Maintain >4.5/5 during migration\n\n## Resource Requirements\n\n### Team Composition\n- 2 Platform Engineers (full-time)\n- 1 DevOps/SRE (full-time)\n- 4 Backend Engineers (rotating, 50% allocation)\n- 1 Database Architect (part-time, 25%)\n- 1 Security Engineer (part-time, 25%)\n\n### Budget\n- Cloud Infrastructure: $50K/month (ramping)\n- Tooling (Monitoring, CI/CD, etc.): $15K/month\n- Training & Consulting: $30K one-time\n- Total 18-month budget: ~$1.2M\n\n## Decision Log\n\n### Architectural Decisions\n- **ADR-001**: Chose Kubernetes over ECS for container orchestration\n- **ADR-002**: Selected gRPC for inter-service communication\n- **ADR-003**: Event-driven architecture with Kafka\n- **ADR-004**: Polyglot persistence (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis)\n- **ADR-005**: API Gateway pattern with Kong\n\n## Governance & Review\n\n- **Weekly**: Engineering standups, blockers\n- **Bi-weekly**: Architecture review board\n- **Monthly**: Steering committee, budget review\n- **Quarterly**: Roadmap adjustment, retrospective\n```\n\n---\n\n## Best Practices\n\n1. **Keep Roadmaps Outcome-Focused**\n   - Focus on problems to solve, not just features to build\n   - Tie features to business objectives and metrics\n   - Use themes to group related work\n\n2. **Make Roadmaps Flexible**\n   - Avoid over-committing to dates far in the future\n   - Use \"Now-Next-Later\" for uncertain timelines\n   - Build in buffer time for unknowns\n\n3. **Prioritize Ruthlessly**\n   - Use data-driven frameworks (RICE, Value vs Effort)\n   - Say \"no\" or \"not now\" to good ideas that don't fit\n   - Consider opportunity cost\n\n4. **Communicate Context**\n   - Explain the \"why\" behind priorities\n   - Share trade-offs and decisions made\n   - Update stakeholders regularly\n\n5. **Review and Adapt**\n   - Treat roadmaps as living documents\n   - Conduct quarterly reviews\n   - Learn from what shipped vs what didn't\n\n## Common Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Over-promising**: Committing to too much too soon\n- **Feature factories**: Building without clear outcomes\n- **Ignoring technical debt**: Only focusing on new features\n- **Lack of dependencies**: Not accounting for prerequisites\n- **No success metrics**: Building without measuring impact\n- **Stakeholder misalignment**: Not getting buy-in early\n\n## Templates\n\nThe skill provides ready-to-use templates for:\n- Quarterly roadmap presentation\n- RICE scoring spreadsheet\n- Value vs Effort matrix\n- Now-Next-Later framework\n- Milestone definition document\n- Feature specification template\n- Roadmap communication email\n",
